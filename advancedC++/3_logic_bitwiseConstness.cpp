1. the return value of fun is a constant pointer pointing to a constant integer value
2. the parameter of fun is a reference of a constant pointer pointing to a constant integer
the reference cannot refer to a different pointer (nature of references)
the referred pointer cannot point to a different value
the pointed value of the referred pointer cannot be changed
3. fun is also a const function, meaning that it cannot directly modify members unless they are marked mutable, also it can only call other const functionsï»¿
